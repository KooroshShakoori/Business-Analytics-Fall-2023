# Business-Analytics-Fall-2023
Learning by doing! I'm sharing my beginner portfolio of mini-projects from my Master's program at ITU. These Python projects explore basic optimization, operation research and machine learning tasks, and I hope they can be a helpful resource for others starting their data science journey. This repository is a showcase for all the projects developed for the "Business Analytics" course. For each assignment, the problem is provided in a pdf file and the answer is in python.
